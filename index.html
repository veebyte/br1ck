            <h2>what even is BR1CK?</h2>
            <p>BR1CK was an exploit released October 27th, 2024. It is capable of unenrolling all devices with a Cr50 chip on the latest version, v130. It has a low chance of being patched without a release of a new Chromebook model.</p>
            <small>Scroll down to see if your device is compatible</small>
        </section>
        <section> 
            <h2>so, how does it work?</h2>
            <p>The exploit works because of an issue that these chromebooks have when enrolling. If you EC reset<sup>[1]</sup> <span class="highlight">↻+⏻</span> at just the right time, it will corrupt some data in the FWMP TPM space<sup>[2]</sup>, resulting in an unreadable FWMP, meaning we can unenroll since we aren't under it's control<sup>[3]</sup> (besides WP). This allows us to boot into sh1mmer, unenroll, and fix the brick with <span class="highlight">gsctool -a -o</span></p>
            <small>1. EC reset = the 2 keys used to forcefully restart the chromebook<br>2. FWMP TPM space = the data used by ChromeOS for enrollment related stuff<br>3. While FWMP is applied, protections are made to stop it from getting removed. These protections are from blocking debug cables to blocking resetting of the TPM (where it is stored)</small>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>how did you even find this?</h2>
            <p>While trying to do CRSH2TTY<sup>[1]</sup>, I ended up bricking my device multiple times (a total of four). One time, I randomly tried to disable write protection while unbricking with a SuzyQ (debug cable), and surprisingly, it worked! This led to the discovery that FWMP doesn't apply while FWMP is corrupted. This functionality is stored in the read-only firmware, which means Google would have to produce updated Chromebooks with the fix to stop this.<br>
            <small>All of my exploits have been made due to CRSH2TTY in some way.<br>1. CRSH2TTY was a (now patched) unenrollment exploit that required resetting at specific times, similar to BR1CK<br></small></p>

                1. Go to the <a href="#timer">section below this one</a> (finding the reset times), go through the process, and memorize the time it gives you, then continue<br>
                2. Powerwash again by signing out, pressing Ctrl+Alt+Shift+R<br>
                3. Proceed through the setup, when "Getting device ready" pops up, get a stopwatch ready and wait for the next "Enterprise enrollment" screen. <br>
                4. When "Enterprise enrollment" pops up, start your stopwatch.<br>
                5. Wait until you're in the ranges of time (I would go for the higher end) the file uploader gave you, perform an EC-Reset by <span class="highlight">↻+⏻</span>.<br>
                6. If chrome turns back on and you get one of the following screens, proceed, otherwise, keep trying (this may take ages but most people can get it in 2-20 tries)<br><center>

                7. Once bricked, get a <a href="https://dl.darkn.bio/SH1mmer/Prebuilt/Legacy">legacy shim</a> or get a <a href="https://dl.darkn.bio/SH1mmer/Prebuilt/Modern">Modern shim</a> (this guide will be using legacy)<br>
                <div><small>(if you do use a modern shim do steps 8-9 and then select "Deprovision" and then open a bash shell and continue from there)</small></div>

                <div><small>If you don't know your board name and still went on with these steps, you can look it up by entering the model name at the bottom on a site like <a href="https://cros.tech">cros.tech</a></small></div>

                12. Type the following command:<pre class="highlight">gsctool -a -o</pre>Press the power button whenever it spams "Press PP button now!" (this will take awhile) <small>whenever it says "Another press will be required" it is telling you to wait, you may have to wait for a minute or even more.</small><br>
                13. Once you're at the end of that process you should reboot and you'll be back at the "Welcome!" screen. (if you don't reboot/gsctool doesn't work, proceed to the bottom section, "errors while unbricking")<br>
                14. Get back into developer mode by pressing <span class="highlight">ESC + ↻ + ⏻</span>, then <span class="highlight">CTRL + D</span>, then <span class="highlight">enter</span>.<br> 
                15.

                16. You may get a "Your system is transitioning into Developer Mode" screen, wait for the 5 minute timer to finish, then follow step 15 again to boot into ChromeOS.<br>
                17. Start setting up your chromebook in OOBE by clicking <span class="highlight">Get Started</span>, going through WiFi, and continuing. Then prepare for the next step. <br>
